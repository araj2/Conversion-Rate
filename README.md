# Conversion-Rate
The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts e-commerce conversion rate and, based on the model, come up with ideas to improve it.

We have data about all users who hit our site: whether they converted or not as well as some of their characteristics such as their country, the marketing channel, their age, whether they are repeat users and the number of pages visited during that session (as a proxy for site activity/time spent on site).

Your project is to:

Predict conversion rate

Come up with recommendations for the product team and the marketing team to improve conversion rate
